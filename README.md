# Overlord Bot
An alert selfbot (script running on non-bot account) for Discordapp. Made by me, using `python.py` by Rapptz, to ease some tedious tasks I've encountered during my moderatorship of Equestria Daily discord server.

You need [python.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) and *probably* [python itself](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to run this.
Follow all the steps for installing `python.py` carefully.

## Features
This bot made **only** for notification purposes. It doesn't do anything except notifications, because I don't turst these metal brains.
Notification of:
-people joining/leaving
-possible raids
-use of banned words
-use of oversized pictures
-other bots getting used outside their allowed zone
-friends getting online
-mentions of your name
and probably something else that I forgot about.

## Token
You need to get your account token and insert it in the `TOKEN = ""` line.
To get your token:
- Press `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`I` in discord.
- [Go here](https://imgur.com/h3g9uf6) and copy your token. **Don't give this out to anyone! This is basically your password.**
Note: If you change your password or enable/disable two-factor authentication, your token will change.
*Thanks to appu1232 for the screenshot*

To run the bot, you can probably just double click it/run via `cmd`, but there is a chance that you might need to start it by manually putting it into command line for python.

## TODO
- [ ] Comment the code
- [ ] GUI
- [ ] Making it less narrow-specialized
