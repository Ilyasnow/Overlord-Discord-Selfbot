# Overlord Bot
An alert selfbot (script running on non-bot account) for Discordapp. Made by me, using `discord.py` by Rapptz, to ease some tedious tasks I've encountered during my moderatorship of Equestria Daily discord server.

You need [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) and *probably* [python itself](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to run this.
Follow all the steps for installing `discord.py` carefully or you might encounter troubles along your way to **rejecting your humanity**.

## Features
This bot made **only** for notification purposes. It doesn't do anything except notifications, because I don't turst these metal brains.
Notification of:
- people joining/leaving
- possible raids
- use of banned words
- use of oversized pictures
- other bots getting used outside their allowed zone
- friends getting online
- mentions of your name

...and probably something else that I forgot about.

## Token
You need to get your account token and insert it in the `TOKEN = ""` line.
To get your token:
- Press `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`I` in discord.
- [Go here](https://imgur.com/h3g9uf6) and copy your token. **Don't give this out to anyone! This is basically your password.**

Note: If you change your password or enable/disable two-factor authentication, your token will change.

*Thanks to appu1232 for the screenshot*

To run the bot, you can probably just double click it or run via `cmd`, but there is a chance that you might need to start it by manually putting it into command line for python.

To stop it, issue a stop command by pressing `Ctrl+C` in the cmd window.
